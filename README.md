⚡ BijliBill – Smart Electricity & Energy Monitoring System

BijliBill is an end-to-end IoT-based smart electricity monitoring system that combines embedded hardware, wireless communication, cloud infrastructure, and a consumer-facing application to deliver real-time electricity usage analytics.

📌 Project Description

BijliBill is designed around a smart electricity and energy meter utilizing 2.9G cellular technology for reliable and continuous data communication. The system captures electrical parameters in real time and transmits the collected meter data via a GPRS communication module to a centralized cloud server, where the data is processed, stored, and visualized.

The associated application retrieves this cloud-hosted data and presents it to end users in real time, enabling consumers to monitor their electricity consumption with detailed graphical and analytical insights.
